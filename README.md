# Lean Microsystems Engineering

This repository contains the contents of the website *Lean Microsystems Engineering*.
The website is available at: http://lean-microsystems-engineering.ch/.

## Website content

The website contains articles and book chapters discussing [Systems Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) methods applied to [Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems) development.

The focus is on "lean" methods for product development. See: https://www.developlean.com/lean-product-development-in-a-nutshell/. 

For each method, illustrative examples are given inspired from the author professional experience (15+ years in microelectronics). 

Whenever possible, the actual computation tools used are open source to lower the adoption barrier.
In most cases, the tools are parts of the Python ecosystem.
