The website contains articles and book chapters discussing [Systems Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) methods applied to [Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems) development.

The focus is on [lean methods for product development](https://www.developlean.com/lean-product-development-in-a-nutshell/).
The methods address all pillars of Systems Engineering:

* Requirements
* Architecture
* Modeling and Analysis
* Verification and validation
* Industrialization

For each method, illustrative examples are given inspired from the author professional experience (15+ years in microelectronics). 

Whenever possible, the actual computation tools used are open source to lower the adoption barrier.
In most cases, the tools are parts of the Python ecosystem.
